# Wallet Score Analysis

This analysis summarizes the credit scoring results from the Aave V2 transaction dataset. A rule-based scoring system was used to assign scores between **0 and 1000** to each wallet.

## Score Ranges

| Score Range | Interpretation                 |
| ----------- | ------------------------------ |
| 0‚Äì100       | Extremely risky / bot behavior |
| 101‚Äì300     | High risk, poor protocol usage |
| 301‚Äì600     | Moderate activity              |
| 601‚Äì800     | Healthy protocol participants  |
| 801‚Äì1000    | Responsible & trusted behavior |

## üîç High-Scoring Wallet Behavior (‚â•800)

These wallets typically:

* Have **high repay-to-borrow ratios** (‚â• 0.9)
* **Rarely or never liquidated**
* Made consistent **deposits over time**
* Show long-term **engagement (many active days)**

**Use Case**: Could be prioritized for higher loan limits or lower fees.

## Low-Scoring Wallet Behavior (‚â§200)

These wallets often:

* Borrow without repaying
* Get liquidated frequently
* Make large but short-term deposits (possibly bots)
* Show bursty activity or single-day interactions

**Use Case**: Risky behavior ‚Äì flag for closer monitoring or rate adjustment.

## Conclusion

The credit scoring logic effectively distinguishes between responsible, stable DeFi users and wallets exhibiting high-risk or exploitative patterns. These scores can be used to:

* Feed into lending protocols
* Drive personalized fee tiers
* Detect bots or malicious actors

Further improvements can be made by integrating:

* Time-based weighting (recent activity matters more)
* On-chain reputation signals
* Machine learning for non-linear patterns
